# Return the first occurrence of the given value at the specified index in

# The goal of this method is to return the actual first occurrence of the
# +value+ in an array. It does so by moving backwards down to index 0
# starting from the specified +index+. It checks if the index at the previous
# is the same as the expected value. If it is, it means that the current
# index is not where the initial occurrence is found in the array.
#
# It continues this until a different value is found at which point it
# validates that the index is where the first occurrence of +value+ can be
# found in the given +array+.
